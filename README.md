# 📘 PLP Assignments

This repository contains all my assignments and projects from the **Power Learn Project (PLP) Software Development Cohort**.  
It is structured to cover the different modules taught during the cohort, including **Python, Web Development, and Databases**.  
The purpose of this repo is to document my learning journey, track my progress, and build a foundation for real-world software engineering projects.
