# 📱 OOP Assignment - Python

This project demonstrates **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts in Python using two tasks:  

1. **Assignment 1:** Designing a custom class (`Smartphone`) with attributes, methods, constructors, and inheritance.  
2. **Activity 2:** Implementing **polymorphism** using a `Vehicle` class and its subclasses (`Car`, `Plane`, `Boat`).

## 🏗 Assignment 1: Smartphone Class

In this part, we designed a class that represents a **Smartphone**.  
- Attributes: `brand`, `model`, `storage`, `battery`
- Methods: `turn_on()`, `turn_off()`, `make_call()`, `charge()`
- Inheritance: `Smartphone` inherits from a parent class `Device`

### Example Output:
```
Samsung S24 is now ON 🔋
Calling John 📞...
Samsung charged to 80% ⚡
Apple iPhone 15 is now ON 🔋
Calling Alice 📞...
Apple iPhone 15 is now OFF 📴
```

## 🎭 Activity 2: Polymorphism Challenge

This part demonstrates **polymorphism** by defining the same method (`move()`) differently in multiple classes.

### Classes:
- `Car.move()` → **Driving 🚗**
- `Plane.move()` → **Flying ✈️**
- `Boat.move()` → **Sailing 🚤**

### Example Output:
```
Driving 🚗
Flying ✈️
Sailing 🚤
```
